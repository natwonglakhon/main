# California Housing Price Prediction

A machine learning project that predicts California median house prices using two models, linear regression (SGDRegressor) and Random Forest, with scikit-learn.

---

## Overview

This project covers a full ML pipeline, starting from raw data exploration and cleaning, through to model training, evaluation, and visualisation, using the California Housing dataset.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [Kaggle - California Housing Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nalisha/california-housing-prices-dataset-clean-and-ml/data)
- **Shape:** 20,640 rows x 10 features (before filtering)
- **Target:** `median_house_value`
- **Features:** `longitude`, `latitude`, `housing_median_age`, `total_rooms`, `total_bedrooms`, `population`, `households`, `median_income`, `ocean_proximity`

---

## Methods

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Filled missing values in `total_bedrooms` with the column median
- Filtered out capped values near $500,000, which is a known artefact in this dataset that hurts model performance

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Applied one-hot encoding (`get_dummies`) on the categorical `ocean_proximity` column, turning 5 categories into 4 dummy variables using `drop_first=True`

### 3. Train/Test Split
- Split the data 70% training and 30% testing using `train_test_split` with `random_state=42`

### 4. Feature Scaling
- Used `StandardScaler` (Z-score normalisation: mean=0, std=1)
- The scaler was fitted only on training data to avoid data leakage into the test set

### 5. Models
- Trained a **SGDRegressor** (Stochastic Gradient Descent linear regression) with `max_iter=2000`
- Trained a **RandomForestRegressor** with varying `n_estimators` (100, 200, 300, 400) to find the best configuration

## Results

| Metric | Linear Regression | Random Forest (n=400) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------|
| R2 Score | 0.615 | 0.791 |

Linear regression gives at 61.5% R2, which is a reasonable baseline. Switching to Random Forest with 400 trees improves this up to 79.1%. The improvement comes from the model being able to capture non-linear relationships in the data that linear regression cannot handle.

The Random Forest was also tested across different numbers of trees (100, 200, 300, 400) and R2 improves gradually as more trees are added.

Looking at feature importance, median income is by far the strongest predictor, accounting for 43.6% of the model's decisions. Location features (latitude and longitude) are the next most influential, which makes intuitive sense for housing prices.

## Lessons Learned

- Always split your data before evaluating. Scoring on training data gives a misleadingly good result.
- Fit the scaler on training data only. Fitting on the full dataset leaks test information into the model.
- Data quality has a real impact. Removing the capped $500k values gave a noticeable improvement in R2.
- Linear regression has limits. When the underlying relationships are non-linear, the model will hit a ceiling no matter how well you tune it.
- Random Forest handles non-linearity well but comes at a cost of higher training time and less interpretability.
- Feature importance gives meaning to the model's score. Knowing that median income drives 43.6% of predictions is far more useful than a number alone.

## Future Improvements

- Try XGBoost to see if it can push R2 beyond the Random Forest result
- Tune Random Forest further using `GridSearchCV` over `max_depth` and `min_samples_split`
- Explore additional feature engineering, such as rooms per household or bedrooms per room
- Add a correlation heatmap to complement the feature importance analysis
