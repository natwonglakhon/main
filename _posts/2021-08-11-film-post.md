During the challenging time of Covid-19 outbreak in Bangkok, I decided to do something new to me, which I bought a new film camera and took a stroll around Bangkok.

Trip from MBK to Sanam Luang, May 27, 2021.

The trip was not actually set off here, but I‚Äôm a big fan of this spot even it is on a scorching day. So, these are the first two of this camera

I then went on my trip by walking along this Klong. No clue why it had to be this Klong. Just thought it would be awesome. It really is.

Met Kiwi siblings.

The thing is there are two kinds of survivors in this challenging time. I don‚Äôt blame anyone except this fucking gov. It‚Äôs sad, but there‚Äôs nothing I can do more. üò¢

My 24th birthday's trip, June 5, 2021.

I was not sure what to do to celebrate my birthday. Ended up going to the China town, Bangkok.
