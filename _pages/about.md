G-day, everyone. My name is Nattaphong Wonglakhon (but you can call my coffee name, Nathan, for convenience ðŸ˜‰). I'm a PhD researcher at Centre for Quantum Dynamics ([CQD](https://www.griffith.edu.au/centre-quantum-dynamics)), Griffith University, Australia.

Grew up in Thailand and now at The Land Down Under
======
I was born and grew up in Sakon Nakhon province, north-eastern region of Thailand. I moved to Bangkok in 2016 to pursue my undergraduate at The Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University. I am currently doing my PhD at Grifftih University. My PhD projects are "Extracting information and controlling quantum systems" where my supervisors are [Dr. Gerardo Paz Silva](https://experts.griffith.edu.au/8207-gerardo-paz-silva) and [Prof. Howard M. Wiseman](https://howardwiseman.me). We are particularly focusing on quantum metrology in the presence of quantum noise and control. 

My previous works

This figure displays a quantum (qubit) system being measured, and the measurement records are then collected. We will use the maps to estimate the quantum trajectories conditioned on those records, which can be used to represtent the quantum system's dynamics.



The previous works (undergrad) focuses on improving quantum continuous (weak) measurement (see Figure above), where I worked with [Dr. Areeya Chantasri](https://areeyachantasri.com) and [Prof. Howard M. Wiseman](https://howardwiseman.me). We proposed a new approach or map which provides a better estimation of quantum trajectory compared to other existing approaches. The new "map" outperforms the others both analytically and numerically.
