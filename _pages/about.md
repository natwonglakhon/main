Hi, everyone. My name is Nattaphong Wonglakhon (but you can go with Nathan for convenience ðŸ˜‰). I'm a PhD student at Centre for Quantum Dynamics ([CQD](https://www.griffith.edu.au/centre-quantum-dynamics)), Griffith University, Australia.

Grew up in Thailand and Branch out to Australia
======
I was born and grew up in Sakon Nakhon province, northeastern region of Thailand. I moved to Bangkok in 2016 to pursue my undergraduate at Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University. I am currently do my PhD at Grifftih University. My PhD project is "Extracting information and controlling quantum systems" where my supervisors are [Prof. Howard M. Wiseman](https://howardwiseman.me), [Dr. Areeya Chantasri](https://areeyachantasri.com) and Dr. Gerardo Paz Silva. So far, we are focusing on quantum metrology and control. 

My previous work
======

The previous work (undergrad) is about quantum measurement. It is something like classical statistics applying to quantum experiments in order to estimate the quantum evolution. My co-workers and I proposed a new "map" in order to simulate a quantum trajectory which is more "accurate" than other existing maps (the paper still in preparation ðŸ¥²).

This figure displays a quantum (qubit) system being measured, and the measurement records are then collected. We will use the maps to estimate the quantum trajectories conditioned on those records, which can be used to represtent the quantum system's dynamics. (Wow, that's too much physics. ðŸ¤¢)


Other interests?
======
I am a big fan of watching movies/shows. I am obsessed with coffee (and I can brew by my own). I go out to run in a regular basis, which I sometimes consider myself as a health freak. Big fan of hiking and Queensland has quite a lot spectactular places to hike!
I guess that's all for now.

Coffee! Coffee! Coffee!
