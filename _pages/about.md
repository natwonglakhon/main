Hi, everyone. My name is Nattaphong Wonglakhon (but I'd prefer calling me "Sparque" ðŸ˜‰). I'm a PhD student at Centre for Quantum Dynamics ([CQD](https://www.griffith.edu.au/centre-quantum-dynamics)), Griffith University, Australia.

Grew up in Thailand and Branch out to Australia
======
I was born in a rural area in Sakon Nakhon province, Northeastern region of Thailand. I moved to Bangkok in 2016 to pursue my undergraduate at Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University. I won scholarships to do my PhD at Grifftih University. My PhD project is "Extracting information and controlling quantum systems" where my supervisors are [Prof. Howard M. Wiseman](https://howardwiseman.me) and [Dr. Areeya Chantasri](https://areeyachantasri.com).

Mention something about your previous work?
======
My work is about quantum information. Well, when it comes to quantum physics, people tend to think about something like sci-fi, explaining something unexplainable, which they probably got from some movies (ha). From my point of (a novice theorist) view, quantum physics is overwhelmed by mathematics. We just explore the [Hilbert Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space). LOL. In terms of my previous work (undergrad), it is something like a classical statistics applying to quantum experiments. I proposed a new "map" in order to estimate a quantum trajectory which is more "accurate" than other existing maps (the paper still in preparation ðŸ¥²).

Apart from physics?
======
Well, this is really ovious. I'm a pro-democracy supporting the 3 demands of the movement. I am interested in politics and believe in human rights. I'm a big fan of watching movies especially western shows. I spend most of time on IG also being a novice of film photography. I'm obsessed with coffee where I brew by my own. I go out to run in a regular basis which I sometimes consider myself as a health freak.
I guess that's all for now.

I love coffee!
