Hi, everyone. My name is Nattaphong Wonglakhon (but I'd prefer calling me "Sparque" ðŸ˜‰). I'm a PhD student at Centre for Quantum Dynamics ([CQD](https://www.griffith.edu.au/centre-quantum-dynamics)), Griffith University, Australia.

Grew up in Thailand and Branch out to Australia
======
I was born and grew up in a rural area in Sakon Nakhon province, northeastern region of Thailand. I moved to Bangkok in 2016 to pursue my undergraduate at Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University. I won scholarships to do my PhD at Grifftih University. My PhD project is "Extracting information and controlling quantum systems" where my supervisors are [Prof. Howard M. Wiseman](https://howardwiseman.me), [Dr. Areeya Chantasri](https://areeyachantasri.com) and Dr. Gerardo Paz Silva.

Mention something about your previous work?
======
My work is about quantum information. Well, when it comes to quantum physics, people tend to think about something like sci-fi, explaining something unexplainable, which they probably got from some movies (ha). From my point of (a novice theorist) view, quantum physics is overwhelmed by mathematics. We just explore the [Hilbert Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space). LOL. In terms of my previous work (undergrad), it is something like a classical statistics applying to quantum experiments. I proposed a new "map" in order to estimate a quantum trajectory which is more "accurate" than other existing maps (the paper still in preparation ðŸ¥²).

This figure displays a quantum (qubit) system is being measured, and the measurement records are then collected. We will use the maps to estimate the quantum trajectories, which can be used to represtent the quantum system's dynamics. (Wow, that's too much physics. ðŸ¤¢)


Apart from physics?
======
Well, it is quite ovious. I am interested in politics and believe in human rights. I'm a big fan of watching movies especially western shows. I spend most of time on IG also being a novice of film photography. I'm obsessed with coffee where I can brew by my own. I go out to run in a regular basis which I sometimes consider myself as a health freak.
I guess that's all for now.

I love coffee!
