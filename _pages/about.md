Hi, everyone. My name is Nattaphong Wonglakhon (but I'd prefer calling me "Sparque" ðŸ˜‰). I'm a PhD student at Centre for Quantum Dynamics ([CQD](https://www.griffith.edu.au/centre-quantum-dynamics)), Griffith University, Australia.

Grew up in Thailand and Branch out to Australia
======
I was born in a rural area in Sakon Nakhon province, Northeastern region of Thailand. I moved to Bankok in 2016 to pursue my undergraduate at Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, Mahidol University. I won scholarships to do my PhD at Grifftih University. My PhD project is "Extracting information and controlling quantum systems" where my superviosrs are [Prof. Howard M. Wiseman](https://howardwiseman.me) and [Dr. Areeya Chantasri](https://areeyachantasri.com).

Mention something about quantum physics?
======
Well, when it comes to quantum physics, people tend to think about something like sci-fi thing which they probably got from some movies. From my point of (theorist) view, quantum physics is overwhelming by mathematics. We just explore the [Hilbert Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space). LOL. In terms of my previous work (undergrad), it is something like a classical statistics applying to quantum experiments. I proposed a new "map" in order to estimate the quantum trajectory which more accurate than other existing maps (the paper still in preparation).

Apart from physics?
------
Well, this is really ovious. I'm a pro-democracy supporting the 3 demands of the movement. I am interested in politics and believe in human rights. I'm a big fan of watching movies especially western shows. I spend most of time on IG also being a novice of film photography. I'm obssessed with coffee where I brew by my own. I go out to run in a regular basis whichi I sometimes consider myself as a health freak.
I guess that's all for now.


How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
